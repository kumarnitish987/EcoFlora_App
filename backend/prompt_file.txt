Given the latitude: {latitude}, longitude : {longitude}, temperature : {temperature}, and precipitation: {precipitation} information of an area, provide a list of plants and trees that are native to that region and can thrive in those conditions. Additionally, include maintenance suggestions for each plant and tree. I will now send data in the format Longitude Latitude Temperature Precipitation. Please provide the response in the following format:
IntroIntroduction: <introduction>
Plants: <name>, <maintenance>,<name>, <maintenance>
Trees: <name>, <maintenance>,<name>, <maintenance>
Spices: <name>, <maintenance>,<name>, <maintenance>
It should show the data in layman terms and not include scientific names of plants
